#+TITLE: OpenGL Container setup for software OpenGL rendering

This container currently only supports OpenGL 3.3, it uses llvmpipe so is limited by the functionality of this software.

See https://mesamatrix.net/ for drivers and support, hopefully we will see version 4 support sometime soon.

Based on another image by thewtex https://github.com/thewtex/docker-opengl but adjusted for CI usage.

To build the container locally use the command below in the repository.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker build -t olymk2/opengl .
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

To launch the container use something similar to this. 
#+BEGIN_SRC 
docker run -it -v /full/path/repos/hgl:/app --entrypoint=/bin/bash olymk2/opengl
#+END_SRC

For an example see olymk2/hgl which uses drone CI to run tests using this on a server with out dedicated hardware.
